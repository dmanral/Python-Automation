# Python Automation

I am going to add each project in its own individual folder.

The project will each have its own README file explaining what it is.

### *Projects so far:*
      - Automated Email
      - Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Programming Udemy course (100% completed).
      - Automate form filling (it doesn't submit the form, but it will fill all the questions).
