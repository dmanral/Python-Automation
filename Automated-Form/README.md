# Python Automate Form Fill
Just a simple script to automate filling out a form. This is for educational purporses only.

## Installs
As always I would say use a virtual environment.

    Create virtual env:
        - virtualenv name_you_want
    Activate virtual env:
        - source name_you_want/bin/activate
    Deactivate virtual env:
        - deactivate

Selenium (mac os):

    pip install selenium
Chromedriver (mac os):

    brew install chromedriver
